One month of steady progress but things are slowing down because I don't have 
a clear vision for where things are going.

The most significant things that need to be done before I can consider this even
close to complete is:

- Dashboard
  - Graphs showing completion rate of various habits
  - Most important habits listed in a unique way
  - View of recent activity would be nice, a bunch of ways to implement this
    so pick one
- Settings
  - At least the settings I've already defined along with actually incorporating
    them into the app
- Detail Section
  - Complete this by finishing the journal and adding a completion chart
    - Go above and beyond by implementing a rich text editor
- List / General
  - Need to be able to narrow down to habits that need to be done on a given day
    and need to show these as important, maybe the progress tracker should not
    show up unless it is a habit that needs to be completed inside the timeframe.
    Might need to restructure the database in some ways to make this easier, 
    currently would need to do searchs in the json array, which would be worth
    learning more about for sure. 
  - Weekly timeframe is completely broken, fix this
- Basic (single page) marketing with pictures and compelling wordses ha.

- Above and Beyond (things to add over time but maybe start a new project first)
  - Habit groups
    - Basically the ability to define sub-habits this one I would want to flesh
      out a lot more before going to deep into it.
  - Todo lists for habits
    - Things that enable the habit, that are things you have to do each dayÂ that
      the habit is tracked
  - Notifications
    - Push / text / email notifications based on preferences, like a weekly
      digest, daily reminders, etc
  - Expanded and refined Login and Registration flow
    - Force users to register so that the information we have is consistent
    - Implement more common SSO providers
  - Basic pricing structure, like a free tier and one tier above that as a sub-
    scription based thing, including wiring up the payment processing
  - Deploy using SST instead of Vercel
  - Get an actual domain?
