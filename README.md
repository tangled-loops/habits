This is going to be my first next hobby project, that I would like to see through until it is deployed,
for this reason I am narrowing the focus of the app specifically to tracking habits, which means redesigning
aspects of it, but I think in the end it will be a good choice, since it does not really make sense to have
a ToDo and Book Tracker if I make a fully featured habit tracking interface it will be more focused and I'll
be able to go deeper into the specific design of the habits.

- Habit Tracker
  - My idea for this is for it to be sort of like a ToDo list except that it doesn't get completed in the same way
    so you'll have a habit group, which needs a better name, that has a set of habits, that are either related in
    some way or that you are working on specifically forming, you'll be able to go in each day and mark which things
    you did or did not do, I think for now they will be yes/no, although maybe as I'm developing it there will be
    an obvious way to add other answers, or maybe it will be more like a counter, although the number of yes and no
    is sort of like a tracker.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
